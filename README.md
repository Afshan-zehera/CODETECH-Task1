OBJECTIVE:
The objective of the project is to Implement various data structures in C++, including linked lists, trees, and
graphs. Each data structure should support standard operations such as
insertion, deletion, traversal, and searching.

KEY ACTIVITIES:
1.Insertion: Add new elements to the data structure.
2.Deletion: Remove existing elements from the data structure.
3.Traversal: Visit all elements in the data structure in a specific order (e.g., in-order, pre-order, post-order for trees).
4.Searching: Find elements within the data structure.

DATA STRUCTURES IMPLEMENTED:
1. Linked list
2. Trees.
3. Graph.
